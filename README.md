# How to use
If you have [Java 17](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase/jdk17-archive-downloads.html) and up installed you can:
- download the .jar executable from the release  
**OR**
- compile and run the repository as a Maven project with your method of choice.</br></br>
`mvn clean compile exec:java` to run from a command.</br></br>

> :warning: **If you run the program with no sound devices existing or connected to your system (if your sound is just muted this doesn't apply)**:  </br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The MIDI sounds will not be loaded, so if you connect any sound device  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;while in the program, it won't be able to play any sounds. Therefore,  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;you need to restart the program, so it can load the sounds it needs.
